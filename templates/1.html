                    <p class="fs-6 mb-4">Addiction is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviours that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences. </p>
                    <p class="fs-6 mb4">Addiction is a complex disease, but nearly a century of scientific study has helped researchers come to a deeper understanding about how it works.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This research has culminated in an important change in how we talk about addiction: Addiction is now classified as a disease that affects the brain, not a personal failing or choice.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Most people think of substance use when they hear about addiction, but that’s not the only type of addiction.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4 mb-4">Most experts recognize two types of addiction:
                      <ul>
                        <li><span class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Chemical addiction : </span>This refers to addiction that involves the use of substances.</li>
                        <li><span class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Behavioral addiction : </span>This refers to addiction that involves compulsive behaviors. These are persistent, repeated behaviors that you carry out even if they don’t offer any real benefit.</li>

                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before getting into the different types of addiction, it’s helpful to understand a few general elements of addiction.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The reward system</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Addiction interferes with normal brain function, particularly in the reward system.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When you do something you find enjoyable, whether that’s hanging out with your best friend, drinking a bottle of wine, or using cocaine, this reward system releases the neurotransmitter <span class="text-primary">dopamine</span> along with other chemicals.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Given the stigma associated with substance use and addiction, this is especially true for addiction medicine. Terminology in this area has long presented challenges to clinicians, patients, family members, policy makers, the media, and the general public.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Prevention efforts and treatment approaches for addiction are generally as successful as those for other chronic diseases.</p>

                      <ol>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">Similar type of study can be done on bigger sample size to reach some conclusion </p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">Interview based study will be more useful in capturing the information </p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">Awareness campaign are required for signs and symptoms of addiction.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">Preventive measures like meditation, yoga and spirituality needs to imbibe amongst adolescent.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">User friendly counselling centers should be available round the clock to provide counselling and guidance for treatment.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">The addiction of any kind shouldn’t be stigmatized, it should be identified as early as possible.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">The government can implement drug testing programs in schools and colleges to deter drug use and help identify students who may be at risk of addiction. This can also help schools to identify and intervene early with students who are using drugs.</p></li>
                        <li><p class="fs-6 mb-4">The government should invest in mental health services to help young people who are struggling with mental health issues that may be contributing to drug addiction. By addressing the root causes of addiction, young people can be empowered to make healthier choices and avoid the dangers of drug addiction.</p></li>
